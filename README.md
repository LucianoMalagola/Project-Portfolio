# Luciano Malagola - Project Portfolio

## About Me

Hello, I’m Luciano Malagola.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from ULATINA, where I built a strong foundation in electronic systems, automation, and embedded technologies. During my studies, I discovered my passion for data, analysis, programming, and IoT, which led me to explore how technology and data intersect to create smarter solutions.

I’m currently pursuing a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Business Data Analytics at ULACIT, while also working toward the IBM Professional Certification in Data Analysis. This combination of hardware expertise and data-driven skills enables me to approach problems with a systems-thinking mindset, bridging engineering and analytics to deliver innovative solutions.

I’m passionate about AI and Machine Learning, especially in applications such as finance, healthcare, supply chain optimization, and predictive modeling. Always curious and eager to learn, I thrive on leveraging data and technology to transform complex problems into actionable insights.

## **Project Portfolio**

  ### Data Science

- #### [Project 1: Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/LucianoMalagola/Montecarlo-Stocks/tree/main)
  An Independent Research Project about Financial Data Modeling and Forecasting.
  
  Direct Link to the Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/LucianoMalagola/Montecarlo-Stocks/blob/main/Montecarlo_Stocks_LucianoMalagola.ipynb)
  - **Goal:** To simulate and forecast stock price movements using Monte Carlo methods, providing insights into potential future price distributions and risk.  
  - **Description:** This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to model the stochastic behavior of stock prices. It uses historical data to estimate parameters and generates multiple simulated price paths, visualizing possible future outcomes and their probabilities.  
  - **Skills:** Financial modeling, Probability and statistics, Data analysis and visualization, Python programming
  - **Technologies:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Relativedelta, sklearn.linear_model), yfinance API, Jupyter Notebook. 
  - **Results / Takeaways:**
    - Developed a flexible tool for simulating stock price scenarios.
    - Gained insights into the impact of volatility and randomness on financial forecasting.
    - Enhanced understanding of risk assessment using probabilistic models.

## About Me

Hello, I’m Luciano Malagola.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from ULATINA, where I built a strong foundation in electronic systems, automation, and embedded technologies. During my studies, I discovered my passion for data, analysis, programming, and IoT, which led me to explore how technology and data intersect to create smarter solutions.

I’m currently pursuing a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Business Data Analytics at ULACIT, while also working toward the IBM Professional Certification in Data Analysis. This combination of hardware expertise and data-driven skills enables me to approach problems with a systems-thinking mindset, bridging engineering and analytics to deliver innovative solutions.

I’m passionate about AI and Machine Learning, especially in applications such as finance, healthcare, supply chain optimization, and predictive modeling. Always curious and eager to learn, I thrive on leveraging data and technology to transform complex problems into actionable insights.
